::callout{color="yellow" icon="i-heroicons-rocket-launch-16-solid"}
that's the main slot
::

```ts [index.ts]
class Studio {
  private name
}
```

Just playing with Nuxt Studio !

Maybe an image would be nice here:

Let's change the color, don't like [purple]{.text-purple-500}.

Here is a listing of all [features]{.text-green-500}:

- one
- [two]{.text-red-500}
- three :shortcut{value="CMD+K"}

Let's add a card component:

::card{color="yellow" icon="i-ph-check" title="Sample Title"}
Hello card
::

Let's add a code block:

```js [amsterdam.vue]
const amsterdam = 'hello'
```

```js
const toto = 'true'
```
